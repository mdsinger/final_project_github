ROUGH DRAFT

OVERVIEW
Utlizing time series and unspervised machine learning a predictive model was created to forecast the probability of flooding in suspectiable populated zip codes. 

TECHNOLOGIES 
Juypter Notebook.
Postgres
Time Series and Unsupervised Machine Learning
Tableau

ETL
Extract data parameters are 1991-2000, 1983, 2011, current and futures forecastation models for 2023-the machine learning enables a baseline operation from which the the forecastation, analysis, and prediciction will be executed from. 

Transform 
The data consist of 6-8 frames. The variables required for transformation are avgerages, medians, sums, percentages, etc. 

Clean
The data exhibts and extrapulates the plausability of flooding in zip codes/real estate developments of high risk.  

MEASUREMENTS 
Medians from 1991 - 2000 will transform the EDA dataframes. The clean data.
