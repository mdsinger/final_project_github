ROUGH DRAFT

OVERVIEW
Utilizing time series and unsupervised machine learning a predictive model was created to forecast the probability of flooding in susceptible populated zip codes.

ETL
Extract data parameters are 1991-2000, 1983, 2011, and current and future forecastation models for 2023-the machine learning enables a baseline operation from which the the forecastation, analysis, and predictions will be executed. 

Transform 
The data consist of 6-8 frames. The variables required for transformation are averages, medians, sums, percentages, etc. 

Clean
The data exhibits and extrapolates the plausibility of flooding in zip codes/real estate developments of high risk.  

MEASUREMENTS 
Medians from 1991 - 2000 will transform the EDA data frames. The clean data.
