ROUGH DRAFT

HYPOTHESIS 
- Utilizing machine learning and ETL create a predictive model create and illustrate using Tableau to forecast the probability of flooding from abrupt snowpack disinegration. Areas of focus; are cities within Salt Lake, Utah and Davis Counties.

ETL

EXTRACT the data parameters below for folllowing dates and locations PAST 01/01/1983 - 05/31/1983 | 01/01/2011 - 05/31/2011 | MEDIAN 01/01/1991 - 05/31/2020 | CURRENT/FUTURES 04/01/2023 - 05/31/2023. 4 types timeframes PAST, MEDIAN, CURRENT/FUTURES each coincedies with an timeset above. 

NOTE: if these locations do not suffice, send me NOAA's weather stations for Utah.
DATA LOCATION Extraction are as follows, using USDA. Salt Lake County (Snowbird (84092), Thayne Canyon (84060), Mill-D  North (84121)) | Utah County (Cascade Mountain (84604), Timpanogos Divide (84003), Hobble Creek (84663)) | Davis County (Farmington (84025), Farmington Lower (84037), Parrish Creek (84014)).

TRANSFROM 

- First step aggregate the data then merge the data into 9 or 10 columns. Assign by date, check and elminate duplicates and nulls. 

- Second clean the data find the correlation.

- Third the outcome, logistical regression. 

Clean
The data exhibits and extrapolates the plausibility of flooding in zip codes/real estate developments of high risk.  

MACHINE LEARNING 

- Try K-Clustering donâ€™t forget to write yourself a legend and colors. 
- Easy ensemble classifier. 
- Utlize keras try them all!

5 TAKEAWAYS/STORYBOARD ILUUSTRATIONS WE NEED TO ARTICULATE FROM ETL AND MACHINE LEARNING.  

We decided to to do this study basedd on the snowfall/snowpack. Based off the record snowfall and snowpack will what flood? 

Are the Resviors full? What are the stream cubic volume currently? What cities and counties are in line with a particular swelling in population to stream flow.

Temperature ? 

Precipatation ? 

Utah County and Salt Lake County Weather Station.
